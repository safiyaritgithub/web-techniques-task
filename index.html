  <h1 class="web">web-Accesibility</h1>
  <p>Equal Access: Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities have equal access to information and services online. It empowers them to browse the web, shop, communicate, and engage with digital content just like everyone else.</p>
  <p>Legal Obligations: Many countries have laws and regulations in place that require websites to be accessible to people with disabilities. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States mandates that public entities, including websites, must be accessible to people with disabilities</p>
  <p>Improved User Experience for All: Making websites accessible often leads to improvements in usability and user experience for everyone, not just people with disabilities. For instance, captions in videos benefit not only deaf users but also those in noisy environments or those who prefer watching videos without sound.</p>
  <h1 class="tech">Techniques</h1>
  <p>Semantic HTML: Using semantic HTML elements correctly is fundamental for accessibility. Semantic HTML elements like nav, header, main, footer, etc., provide meaning and structure to the content, making it easier for assistive technologies like screen readers to interpret and navigate the page.</p>
    <p>Keyboard Accessibility: Many users, including those with motor disabilities, rely on keyboards rather than mice for navigation. Ensuring that all interactive elements on a webpage are keyboard accessible is critical for providing an inclusive user experience. This means that users should be able to navigate through links, buttons, form fields, and other interactive elements using only the keyboard, without requiring a mouse.</p>
